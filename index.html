            <p>Many people have practically no idea who Sacha Baren Cohen is. This is because the show he 
                 had, Da Ali G Show, was a very unpopular show. Unfortunately, many people never watched the show not because they
                   didn't like it, but because they didn't know it existed. Da Ali G Show was an incredibly
                    original variety/reality show featuring Cohen in three roles including Borat (whom is the
                     main character of the movie). Cohen, posing as these different characters would interview
                      politicians and such who were unaware the interview was a joke. The reactions Cohen would
                       get out of people including one politician telling him to 'go f*ck himself', were 
                       priceless. Going into the one-month early sneak-preview of 'Borat', I was expecting 
                       a funny movie, but was skeptical on how funny the movie would be. Usually film 
                       adaptations of short five minute skits don't work so well. However,
                         when the ending credits started to roll and I walked out of the 'Borat' screening
                          I was sore from laughing so hard. To be honest, I never laughed so hard during a
                           movie in my entire life.</p>
